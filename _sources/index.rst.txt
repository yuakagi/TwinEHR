TwinEHR Documentation
======================

| TwinEHR is a prototype web-based digital-twin electronic health record (EHR) system integrating a generative AI backend. 
| It simulates patient futures by using real patient timelines as prompts, and feedbacks the simulated trajectories to the EHR interface.
| Potential downstream applications include personalized medicine, counterfactual simulation, and in-silico clinical 
trialsâ€”advancing the role of AI in transforming clinical practice.
